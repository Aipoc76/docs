## Syntax

**<span style="color:red">/beep</span>** \[ *filename* \]

## Description

Invokes a system beep (beep from the built-in PC speaker).

Adding *filename* will play a .wav file located in your Everquest directory. This function uses the In-game sound so
while a normal /beep will sound if you have EQ muted, this will not.

If you prefer you can play the sounds in the Everquest "sounds" directory by using something like

/beep sounds/*filename*
