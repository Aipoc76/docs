## Syntax

**<span style="color:red">/lootall</span>**

## Description

-   **/lootall** allows you to loot everything on the corpse that is *not* No Trade. You must manually loot those unless
    you have [/lootnodrop](../eq-commands/lootnodrop.md) set to never.
-   Using **/lootall** will loot *everything* on the corpse automatically unless there is more than one No Trade item on
    it. In this case, you will have to loot everything (including the item(s) that are not No Trade) manually.

## Examples

-   **Will loot everything**:

<!-- -->

    Slot 1: Diamond
    Slot 2: Jacinth
    Slot 3: No Trade Item

-   **Will** *not* **loot everything**:

<!-- -->

    Slot 1: Diamond
    Slot 2: Jacinth
