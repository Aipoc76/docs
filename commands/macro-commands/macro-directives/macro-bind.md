# \#bind

## Description

\#bind Creates an ingame slash command that can be used to call the related sub routine while the macro is running Instead of sending yourself a keyword to trigger a \#event you can just type /saymana and it will execute the function called "Sub Bind\_SayMana"

## Use

* **\#bind\_noparse** UpdateSomething /updatesomething
* **\#bind** SayMana /saymana
* bind gives a user a command they can use
* bind\_noparse gives a user a command they can use that doesn't get parsed.

## Triggers On

Binds only get triggered / parsed on certain things, such as /invoke /varset /echo /call Sub. To trick binds to be called often you can substitute your /doevents as a function like

```text
#bind TargetClosestNPC /near

Sub Main
   /call Do_Events
/return

Sub Do_Events
   /doevents
/return

Sub Bind_TargetClosestNPC
    /echo Targeting the closest NPC becuase you typed /near
    /target ${NearestSpawn[npc]}
/return
```

## Example

```text
#bind MyMana /MyMana

Sub Main
 /declare CurMan int outer 0

 :loop
   /varset CurMan ${Me.CurrentMana}
   /doevents
   /delay 5
 /goto :loop
/return

Sub Bind_MyMana
  /call MyMana
/return

Sub MyMana
  /echo My Mana is ${CurMan}
/return
```
