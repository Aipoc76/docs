# Loadspells

**/loadspells** _**spellset**_

```text
Loads the specified spellset.

This is the same as the EQ command /memspellset, with the addition that it only memorizes the spellset if it is not already memorized. This command was part of MQ2 long before EQ added the same functionality.
```

**/loadspells list**

```text
Lists all of your saved spellsets in the MQ2 chat window.
```

**/loadspells list** _**spellset**_

```text
Lists the spells in the specified spellset in the MQ2 chat window.
```
