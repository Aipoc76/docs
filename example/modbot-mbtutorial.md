Welcome to the wonderful world of ModBot! The following is a brief tutorial/guide to get you up and running with ModBot.
It is assumed at this point that you already know how to compile MQ2 and any associated plugins - if you do not, please
refer to the [main page](https://macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) of the MQ2 wiki or the [MQ2
Forums](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/index.php) for information on how to compile. Until you get compiling nailed
down, ModBot will be somewhat useless to you :).
