## Description

This is currenly not a supported TLO. This page was added as a visual representation of JacenSolo's idea for an Event
TLO. In theory, this TLO would allow access to information regarding Events, such as if any had been triggered.

## Forms

-   *[event](../data-types/datatype-event.md)* **Event**

## Access to Types

-   *[event](../data-types/datatype-event.md)* **event**

## Examples

`/echo There are currently ${Events.Triggered} triggered events.`
