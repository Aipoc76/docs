## General

EQEmu (or EQEmulator) is a free (under GNU GPL) open source EverQuest server emulator. Using EQEmu you can create and
run your own EverQuest server, or play on servers other people have created. Some servers play exactly like EQLive,
while others have custom content such as zones, NPCs, equipment, allowing players to do what they want, or giving them
access to GM commands. Some EQEmu content may be missing, buggy, and/or unplayable (e.g. certain AAs and zones).

## Use with MQ2

Currently, using EQEmu requires a clean, unpatched install of EverQuest Titanium Edition to run. To run MacroQuest 2
with EQEmu, version [MQ2-20051116](https://macroquest2.com/downloads/MQ2-20051116.zip), which can be downloaded from
the [MQ2 archives](https://macroquest2.com/downloads/zips.php). Note that because this is an older version of MQ2,
not all the features or bug fixes from the most recent version will be present.
