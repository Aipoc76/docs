# NamingSpawn

So this topic doesn't have it's own Forum catagory that I saw. So I'm creating a thread in Macro Mania because it's to do with coding logic that follows along the same guidelines as the MQ2HUD.ini in a way.

I'm talking about the \[Captions\] section of Macroquest.ini that most people don't even know exists. The \[Captions\] section uses a little known TLO that's not echoable in MQ2 that inherits the "Spawn" datatype to display information on NPC's and players. It's the code that shows you the details of player/NPC/pet spawns in MQ2.

Why do you care? Well recently I created a HUD that got a lot of positive attention. the logic used to create the HUD is a lot like the logic that will be used to explain the captions section of Macroquest.ini

What can you do with \[Captions\] section of the Macroquest2.ini, well. See for yourself what I've done in a few minutes of coding using the ${NamingSpawn} TLO.

This is an altered form of the \[Captions\] section of the macroquest.ini

I've changed NPC= section to display the information I want to see.

The ${NamingSpawn} inherits the spawn data type. [https://macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/DataType:spawn](https://macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/DataType:spawn)

While the wiki is certainly dated, just with that link alone you can find a lot of information. Basically anything you see in that list should be allowed to attach to the end of ${NamingSpawn}. You can test them with ${Target.datamember} IE: ${NamingSpawn.Body} will display "Humaniod", "Animal", "Plant", "Undead", etc so you can just look at the targets name and see if you can use your body specific spells/banestrike. I've added distance using ${NamingSpawn.Distance} and there is a lot more that you can add that I just haven't done yet.

Limitations - You're only allowed two lines. So while you can \n to go to a next line, you can only do this once as two lines is the maximum.

Player1, Player2, Player3, etc......what does it mean? The players are directly attached to /shownames 1, 2, 3, 4 etc in game. This only applies to player information.

So if you want /shownames 1 to not show anything at all, you can do something like. Player1=${If\[${NamingSpawn.ID},,\]}

Someone recently mentioned mobs Feigning Death in EQ. Well perhaps you want to add ${NamingSpawn.Feigning} to the display of NPC's? ${If\[${NamingSpawn.Feigning},FD,\]} will display FD if the NPC is FD.

Want to know what spell a player is casting? Add ${If\[${NamingSpawn.Casting.ID}, Casting: ${NamingSpawn.Casting},\]} to the Player\# you want to show that information. Great for PVP when you want to stop a player from casting a heal by stunning them but don't want to waste your bash/stun on a trivial spell that won't save their life. /evil grin.

So as you can see this is a very powerful feature that most players either don't know exists or don't know how to edit.

Got your captions setup already? type /captions anon on, then take a screenshot and post it along with the associated code!

--Update-- \[QUOTE=KingArthur;348346\] And is there anyway to reload the settings other than a totally relog?? is there any slash command like /reload or something? Ty'''

I completely overlooked this question. The answer is YES~!

So if you make changes and want to test them you have to type

```text
/unload
```

Then right click on the tray icon for MQ2 and hit "Refresh injections"

That will effectively reload the MacroQuest.ini and update your \[Captions\]

I don't know of any other way other than this.

**How does an ${If\[,,,\]} statement work?**

The following is how an ${If\[,,,\]} statement works.

```text
${If[ThisIsTrue,DoThis,ElseDoThis]}
```

**How does a ${Select\[,\]} statement work?**

The following is how a ${Select\[,\]} statement works.

```text
${Select[CompareThis,toThis,andThis,andThis]}
```

if CompareThis is equal toThis, OR andThis, OR andThis then it evaluates TRUE.

Example of a Select statement.

```text
${Select[${NamingSpawn.ID},${Group.Member[1].ID},${Group.Member[2].ID},${Group.Member[3].ID}]}
```

The above code evaluates true if the Spawn's ID is the first, second, or third group member in your group window.

**How do I nest an ${Select\[,\]} inside an ${If\[,,,\]}**

You would do

```text
${If[${Select[CompareThis,toThis,andThis,andThis]},IfTrueDoThis,IfFalseDoThis]}
```

**What if I don't want it to do anything if it's false?**

You leave the Else portion blank.

```text
${If[ThisIsTrue,DoThis,]}
```

**What can I do with ${NamingSpawn}**

NamingSpawn appears to inherit all members of ${Spawn\[\]} TLO. Therefore the following list should be available to ${NamingSpawn}. Some things may only apply to the current character you are playing.
