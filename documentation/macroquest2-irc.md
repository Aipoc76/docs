# MacroQuest2:IRC

**Server:** irc.lavishsoft.com  
**Channel:** \#macroquest

In order to connect to the IRC server, you'll need an IRC client. Some IRC clients are:

* [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/)  
* [Miranda Instant Messenger](http://www.miranda-im.org)  
* [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com)

To join the channel, you first need to register your nickname with the Nickserv bot. You can do this by sending it a message in the following format:

`/msg nickserv register<your@email.com>`

After registering your nick, on subsequent connections to the server, you'll have to identify yourself before joining the channel.

`/msg nickserv identify`

After identifying to nickserv, you may join a channel.

`/join #macroquest`

Some basic IRC commands:

`/me- Displays an emote.`  
`/nick- Change your display name.`  
`/msg- Send a private message to a user. (Alternately, you can use /query in the mIRC client)`  
`/part - Leave the current channel.`  
`/quit - Self explanitory.`  
`/whois- Gain detailed information about a specific user.`

It is also wise to not ask overly stupid questions in \#macroquest, or you run the risk of being flamed by eqjoe.
