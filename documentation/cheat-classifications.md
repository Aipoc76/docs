When the VIP forums opened, Lax posted a little system of classifying cheats or
"hacks".

-   **Passive** hacks are those that show different information without really changing the rules. For example, "fish
    eyes" or "ultravision" would simply show how you can see things. It doesnt require you modifying properties of a
    character or item to do so, this can be done just by telling the display to show you things differently.
-   **Active** hacks are those that could warp you around or otherwise really change the rules of how the game plays.
    "mounts without models" is an "active" hack. It's modifying the rules of the game by allowing you to use a horse
    without having models on, but is not going to give the server the impression that you are cheating because the
    server doesnt know if you have models on or not.
-   **Server-Active** hacks broadcasting information to the server that could possibly give you away if they wanted to
    put in a check for it. "Warping" is an example of a Server-Active hack.

Note that our [Rules](rules.md) allow for most Passive hacks, but NOT Active or Server-Active hacks.
