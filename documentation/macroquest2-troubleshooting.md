The first steps to getting help on a problem are:

-   [SEARCH](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/search.php) the MQ2 forums for other people who've had the same problem. If
    you're getting an error message while compiling (either MQ2 itself or a plugin), its easiest to copy the error
    message into the search field. A good tip is to click the Display Results as Posts button, which should give you a
    preview of the relevant posts, rather than just the threads, which can at least help you narrow down your search. A
    large majority of problems can be resolved by using search and reading a bit. *And most of the time its quicker than
    posting a question, getting flamed and then having to use search a few hours later anyway.*
-   If you're having a problem with a specific macro/plugin (which includes configuring the macro, or "getting it to do
    what you want"), then you'll most likely find the answer to your question within the thread itself. Always read the
    first page (ie. page 1) of the macro/plugin/snippet, as the author usually has all the pre-requisites and known
    issues outlined there. There's also often some handy tips and sometimes link(s) to documentation that others may
    have provided.
-   Make sure you pay attention to any other plugins/macros/snippets that are required in order to run the plugin/macro.
    Make sure you follow the instructions in this main post
-   If you've put in the legwork (and by this, I mean **at least** 30 mins of searching and reading) and still can't
    find the answer to your question, then it may be time to post your question/problem.

***If you don't search or follow the simple directions above, expect to be flamed when posting your question to the
boards.***

### How to post your question

-   If your question is about a specific macro/plugin, go to the main forum post where you obtained the macro/plugin and
    post a reply to that thread. The reason for this is that most macro/plugin authors monitor their threads actively
    and respond to posts/questions within them. As do some of the more knowledgeable users of said macro/plugin.
-   If your question is about MQ2 itself (compile problems, etc), you can post a question to the forums using the
    information in the Help_Forums.
-   Include as much information as possible in your post (including all error messages, when they happen, etc) so that
    people can actually help you. "It doesn't work" is not going to elicit any useful responses.
