# Identify Code Errors

Finding errors in a perticular part of a macro can be a challenge but never impossible. After an unsuccessfull attempt to get the macro to run an eror message was generated. "Due to complete misuse of the String Top-Level Object, it has been removed."

Here we look at two pieces from the Cleric Bot macro.

/varset Classes ${String[${SpellBuff\[${i},2\]}\].Count\[,]}

`/if (${Spawn[${sID}].Class.Name.Equal[${String[${SpellBuff[${i},2]}].Arg[${h},,]}]}) {`

Since ${String\[ is no longer valid attempt to remove and re-run the macro. With $String\[ removed the error is gone, but now a new error is present.

No such 'bool' member 'Arg' ClericBot.mac@2031 (singlebuffs\): /if \(${Spawn[${sID}\].Class.Name.Equal\[${String\[${SpellBuff\[${i},2\]}\].Arg\[${h},,\]}]}\) { ClericBot.mac@789 \(Main): /if \(${Me.PctMana}&gt;40 /if........./call SingleBuffs Unparsable in Calculation

Following the code the macro is testing predetermined conditions then calling the single buff routine. Once that routine is called the new error is generated.
