## Description

<span style="color:red">#turbo</span> <span style="color:blue">###</span>

This will prevent bad macros from locking up the client by allowing you to limit the number of commands per iteration.

## Use

The default is 10, while the maximum value is 120.

A value of 1 will essentially disable #turbo.

**#turbo** is active with the default of 10 in all macros even if you do not use #turbo in your macro. Setting #turbo to
0 will set the value to 20.

## Example


    #turbo 120
