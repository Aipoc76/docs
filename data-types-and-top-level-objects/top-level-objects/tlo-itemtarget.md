# TLO:ItemTarget

## Description

ItemTarget _We used to allow targeting of ground spawn but then sony started sending a packet that would be a give away._  
_So I added ItemTarget which is still a spawn but the ID is always 0, e.g. untargetable._  
_- dont\_know\_at\_all_

* To check that you have a valid ground spawn targeted, use **${ItemTarget.Race.ID}**
* Non-zero values indicate the DropID of the item.
