### Example

-Previously Added: .CachedBuffCount to the spawn tlo. it returns -1 if no buffs are cached for the spawn or number of buffs cached.

-Previously Added: .CachedBuff\[x\] to the spawn tlo where x is a spellid if its a number and a spell name if not. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.

-Previously Added: .CachedBuff\[\#x\] to the spawn tlo where \#x is a buffslot between 1-97. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.

-Previously Added: .CachedBuff\[\*x\] to the spawn tlo where \*x is a index \(buffslots are not sorted\). It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.

-Previously Added: .CachedBuff\[^x\] to the spawn tlo where ^x is a keyword. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.

`^x keywords: Slowed Rooted Mezzed Crippled Maloed Tashed Snared and Beneficial`

-Using CachedBuff to get buff info on targets, group members etc, only requires you to target the entity once. after thats done, buffs are cached. -The upside is obviously that we don't have to target back and forth constantly.

`Usage: well lets say you are a druid and you want to know if a group members sow buff has worn off, you can just check CachedBuff without having to retarget the group member.`  
`/echo ${Group.Member[2].CachedBuff[Spirit of Wolf].Duration}`
