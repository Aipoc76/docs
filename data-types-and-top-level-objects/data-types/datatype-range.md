## Members

| **Type** | **Member** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Between[**\#1,\#2:_n_] | is _**n**_ Between the range of _\#1_ and _\#2_ both numbers included |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Inside[**\#1,\#2:_n_] | is _**n**_ Inside the range of _\#1_ and _\#2_ both numbers excluded |

## Examples

### .Between

/echo Is 50 between 33 and 66?: ${Range.Between[33,66:50]}

`Is 50 between 33 and 66?: TRUE`

/echo Is 25 between 33 and 66?: ${Range.Between[33,66:25]}

`Is 25 between 33 and 66?: FALSE`

### .Inside

/echo Is 50 Inside 33 and 66?: ${Range.Inside[33,66:50]}

`Is 50 Inside 33 and 66?: TRUE`

/echo Is 33 inside 33 and 66?: ${Range.Inside[33,66:33]}

`Is 33 between 33 and 66?: FALSE`
