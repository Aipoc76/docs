# DataType:groupmember

## Introduction

Contains data on a specific group member

## Members

|  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **Member** | **Description** |
| [_int_](datatype-int.md) | **Index** | Which number in the group the member is |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Leader** | TRUE if the member is the group's leader, FALSE otherwise |
| [_int_](datatype-int.md) | **Level** | The member's level |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **MainAssist** | TRUE if the member is designated as the group's Main Assist, FALSE otherwise |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **MainTank** | TRUE if the member is designated as the group's Main Tank, FALSE otherwise |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Mercenary** | TRUE if the member is a mercenary, FALSE otherwise |
| [_string_]() | **Name** | The name of the group member. This works even if they are not in the same zone as you. |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Offline** | TRUE if the member is offline and FALSE if online |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **OtherZone** | TRUE if the member is online but in another zone and FALSE if online and in same zone as you. |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Present** | TRUE if the member is online and in same zone and FALSE if online and not in same zone as you. |
| [_bool_](datatype-bool.md) | **Puller** | TRUE if the member is designated as the group's Puller, FALSE otherwise |
| [_spawn_](datatype-spawn.md) | **Spawn** | Accesses the group member's spawn directly. This is only really needed to access **Spawn.Name**, instead of **GroupMember.Name**, as [_spawn_](datatype-spawn.md) is inherited automatically. |
| '**'**[**string**]() | **To String** | Same as **Name** |

## Examples

`/echo ${Group.Member[0].Leader}`

Echo TRUE if you are Group Leader.

`/echo ${Group.Member[3].Puller}`

Echo TRUE if Group Member 3 is marked as Role Puller
