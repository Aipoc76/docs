## Welcome to the MQ2Plugin Project Page

This project is intended to combine the skills of several of the very active plugin developers by using a SF project
page to manage each of the plugins so that it is easyer for all of the developers to have current versions of the
plugins and quickly edit or add new features to a plugin even if they are not the origional creators of said plugins.

s0rcier is the project Admin along with Digitalxero. Digitalxero started this project along time ago and no longer
players Everquest but still keeps up with whats going on with MQ2 so he handed the project over to s0rcier in the hopes
that it will get utilized again.

The SF project page is located [1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mq2plugin/)

Plugins Currently in the project:

-   [MQ2Melee](mq2melee.md)
-   MQ2SpellTimer
-   [MQ2NetBots](mq2netbots.md)
-   [MQ2NetHeal](mq2netheal.md)
-   [MQ2Cursor](mq2cursor.md)
-   [MQ2Targets](mq2targets.md)

Plugins we are hoping to add:

-   [MQ2Cast](mq2cast.md)
-   [MQ2EQBC](mq2eqbc.md)
-   [MQ2Debuffs](mq2debuffs.md)
-   [MQ2Events](mq2events.md)
-   [MQ2Twist](mq2twist.md)
-   MQ2BardSwap

Any Others if the developers are interested in adding thier plugin to the project.

Have a Macro you want added to this project, you can contact Digitalxero or s0rcier to get added to the project. The
Macros we will be accepting are large project macros such as AutoBot, the smaller macros are simple enough to manage via
the message board.
