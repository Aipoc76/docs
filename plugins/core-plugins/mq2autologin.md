## Description

AutoLogin is a plugin that automatically logs in your characters. It can also switch characters, servers and login new accounts via commandline.

There are three typical ways to login, 

1. MQ2Login via tray icon gui right click (recommended)
2. AutoLogin via the EverQuest launcher or a windows shortcut with `-patchme`  
3. Autologin via ISBoxer or WinEQ using station name with `-patchme`

## 1. MQ2Login via tray icon

Right click on your MacroQuest tray icon

Select Profiles-&gt;Create New.

You'll be asked to enter nine fields:

1. Profile Set: (This creates "groups" of profiles, enter any custom name) 
2. EQ Path: (Path to eqgame.exe)
3. Login: (EverQuest login)
4. Password:  (EverQuest password)
5. Server: (Server short name)
6. Character Name: 
7. Class: (Optional)
8. Level: (Optional)
9. Hotkey: (Assign a key or combination of keys to bring this character's window to the front)

Upon clicking "Save", your profile will be encrypted and saved in mq2autologin.ini

## 2. AutoLogin via EverQuest launcher or a windows shortcut with -patchme

Configure the ini file \(named: MQ2AutoLogin.ini\) with your account information in plaintext. See below for an example.

## 3. Autologin via ISBoxer or WinEQ using station name with -patchme

Alternatively, you can use station names rather than sessions \(handy if you use ISBoxer or WinEQ2 profiles\). See below for an example.

## Commands

`/switchserver <server short name> <character name>`

Will log out your current character and log in the specified server/character on the same account. 

`/switchchar <name>`

Will log out your current character and log in the specified character on the same account/server. 

`/loginchar [server:character|profile_server:character|server^login^character^password|server^login^password]`

Will open a new EverQuest instance and login the specified character. Example: `/loginchar vox:bobby`

`/relog [#s|#m]`

Will log character out, and then log back in after specified time. Default time is in seconds. Example: `/relog 5m`

## INI configuration values

MQ2AutoLogin has 3 types of sections

1. The global settings under [Settings]
2. The [Profiles] section and encrypted character sections, which are auto-generated by MQ2Login and not for users to edit directly.
3. Optional sections for alternate login methods, under either [Session#] or [LoginName]

**Section = \[Settings\]**
```ini⏎
[Settings]
;The following settings are global. Settings changed for specific characters will override them.
NotifyOnServerUp=1
;0 is off, 1 is beep, 2 is email via MQ2Gmail
KickActiveCharacter=1
;0 is off, 1 is on. Will attempt to boot an active player to log in.
EndAfterCharSelect=1
;0 is off, 1 is on.
CharSelectDelay=3
;seconds to wait at the character select screen. Default is 3
ConnectRetries=0
;How many attempts to connect after a failure
UseMQ2Login=1
;Uses the default, encrypted method of autologin
UseStationNamesInsteadOfSessions=0
;Stores your login and pass in plaintext in MQ2AutoLogin.ini, but is compatible with ISBoxer/WinEQ.
```
If you're using `UseMQ2Login=1` and have created profiles via the tray icon, there will be additional sections such as `[Profiles]` and profile names. These should be left alone, as their settings are best changed via the GUI.

**Section = \[Session\#\] or \[LoginName\]**

If you prefer to use sessions (method 2) or station names (method 3) to log in, make sure your [Settings] reflect this preference, and then add session or station name sections with the format:

**Sessions example INI**
```ini⏎
[Settings]
UseMQ2Login=0

[Session1]
StationName=StationNameforSession
Password=PasswordforSession
Server=ServerforSession
Character=Name

[Session2]
StationName=StationNameforSession
Password=PasswordforSession
Server=ServerforSession
Character=Name
```
and this format for station names,

**Station names example INI**
```ini⏎
[Settings]
UseMQ2Login=0
UseStationNamesInsteadOfSessions=1

[StationName1]
Password=PasswordforThisLoginName
Server=ServerforThisLoginName
Character=CharacterforThisLoginName

[StationName2]
Password=PasswordforThisLoginName
Server=ServerforThisLoginName
Character=CharacterforThisLoginName
```

Additional settings from the global section, such as `KickActiveCharacter=1` can be added to session or station name sections to affect only that character.

## MQ2Login Profiles GUI

\(Right click on the MacroQuest tray icon\)

`Check marks:`

A checked character will be loaded when clicking "Profile->Load All". Right-clicking a character's name will toggle the checkmark on or off.

`Loading individual accounts:`

Left click on a character name and if checked, it will login and load MacroQuest. Left-clicking a loaded character will unload MacroQuest for that character.

`Batch Files and hotkeys:`

If you currently use batch files or hotkeys or whatever, those should still be usable if you don't want to click the menu. Example: \(this example assumes you HAVE profiles created with "Create New..." in mq2autologin.ini\) Batch file can launch your accounts by sending the server\_charname to the eqgame client like this:  patchme /login:drinal\_eqmule And that's really all there is to it... You would of course change the server and Charname to your server and your char \(drinal and eqmule\)

`Encryption:`

If you make profiles via the tray icon GUI, they are encrypted in your MQ2AutoLogin.ini. Moving your file to another computer or changing computer hardware will invalidate these logins, so please use import/export for backup and moving purposes.

`Import/Export profiles`

This helps export and import login profiles, which are otherwise hard to decrypt. 

`Launch Clean`

Launch single sessions without logging in.
