## Description

-   Keeps your list of buddies (per character) and the last time they were seen online or on EQIM (by any character).
    Your friends list is automatically added as buddies.
-   Notifies you when someone on your EQIM buddy list logs in or out.

**Note:** Since changing the EQ chat system to the Universal Chat System, this plugin (and Sony's official EQIM) no
longer works.
